# F.A.Q
DNS Resolver Hack

# DNS Resolver Hack Machines
1. Windows/*nix/mac running custom DNS softwares via MIRC/IRC or sometimes outside IRC/MIRC Network
2. Even if they are behind LAN/NAT you will still get access
3. This does not work on websites/web systems

# DNS Resolver Hack Details
1. This is POC where you can request a DNS Forgery for any pc in the world, where there are shares or null shares ipc$ which
gives access to printers, routers, or anything connected to that machine, you will get access. If you stuck in access, you
will exactly know his/her username for pc, where you can brute force later on.

# DNS Resolver Hack Attack Method
DNS Resolver is a software service running on any computer, in this case MIRC/IRC Network. DNS Resolver service forwards DNS 
Queries to the DNS Server, in this case MIRC/IRC DNS Server for Name Resolution, on behalf of Operating System using DNS
Resolver (a DNS Client) and other applications, this is where DNS Resolver ask DNS Name Server to provide information and
resolve specific IP to Address. This will cause our DNS query to resolve for DNS Server going from MIRC/IRC Server to
victim DNS, once resolve, we can access his/her pc shares or null shares remotly, as if we are into his/her local network.

# Types of Access
1. There would be read access
2. There would be write access
3. There would be read/write access

# Null Shares
If you are connected to null shares, you will see something like routers, printers, scanners, remote machines

# Shares
If you see hard disk, your in luck, if you hack VHOST, you will see many hard disks in network
